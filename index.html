          Practice the workflow of redesigning a simple website. Identify design flaws of an existing website, and recreate a more effective, responsive website design.

        <p>
          The layout of a website is critical for effectively conveying information to a user. 
          In this project, I will analyze and redesign the web page for Russell Orchards, a popular farm and apple orchard in Massachusetts. 
          Their website details sufficient information about the orchard, but the website has many usability problems and can more effectively convey information in a different format. 
          My redesign will focus on simplicity and enhancing usability. 
          <br>
          I chose to redesign the website for Russel Orchards because I found the website difficult to interact with when I tried to plan a trip to the farm; it took me too long to find information about pricing and time for apple picking. 
          An image of the website is shown below.
        </p>

        <h2>Visual Redesign</h2>
        <p>
          After identifying issues with the website, I will redesign the home page to address these issues. Throughout the redesign process, there are two points that I kept at the forefront of my mind: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I assumed that the goal of this website is to draw as many customers to the farm as possible. This point is critical to many of the features that I changed on the website. 
          </li>
          <li>
            I tried to maintain as much content from the original website as possible. There are some items (ex. Blog and recipes) that I personally did not find critical, but I assumed the owners of the orchard are passionate about these points and would like for them to remain present on the website. 
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          First, I created three wireframes using Balsamiq to address the issues I found.
        </p>

        <div class="lofi-interface">
          <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/lofi-website.png" alt="Lofi Prototype of website" height="600">
          <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/lofi-tablet.png" alt="Lofi Prototype of tablet" height="600">
          <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/lofi-mobile.png" alt="Lofi Prototype of mobile" height="600">
        </div>


        <ol>
          <li>The <b>logo </b>and menu bar should be pinned to the top of the page to provide users convenient access throughout their experience.</li>
          <li>
            The <b>menu bar </b>has been moved to the top of the page because I found it to be more intuitive. I grouped the following categories together to streamline selections for the user:
            <ul>
              <li>“Store” now includes the Bakery and the shop. </li>
              <li>“Events” now includes Winery, School Tours, Farm Animals, and Calendar
              </li>
              <li>“Contact” now includes Employment and Contact.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          On a tablet and mobile screen, the menu bar should condense into a hamburger menu so that the text does not overlap. This makes the website responsive.

          <li>I removed the background image and plan to include a dynamic <b>slideshow of images </b>from the farm. This enables the user to see image without hindering readability of text. </li>
          <li>I added a <b>slogan </b>to catch the eye of the user. This draws the user into this section of the website, which should provide a brief description about the farm. If the user only reads one portion of the website, it should be this block of text. 
          </li>
          <li>I included a <b>dynamic button</b>. The goal of the website is to draw as many users to the farm as possible, and this button should be the item that pops out most to the user.</li>
          <li><b>Short description</b> with hyperlinks of events/features that make this apple orchard unique from others. </li>
          <li>I designated a larger portion of the website for the <b>location</b>. The location should be made evident to the users in order to draw them to the farm. The hours for the farm are all listed in one place.</li>
          <li><b>Social media</b> is blocked together in one portion of the website. </li>
        </ol>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
          I created a visual design style guide to document specific details about the website. The guide documents interactive elements I have on my website, specifically with the buttons along the menu bar.
        </p>

        <div class="interface">
          <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/style-guide.png" alt="Visual style guide" width="800">
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>


        <p>
          I then used Figma to create high-fidelity prototypes of what the website will look like, taking into account responsiveness of the website.
        </p>

        <div class="lofi-interface">
          <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/hifi-web.png" alt="Hifi prototype of website" height="800">
          <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/hifi-tablet.jpg" alt="Hifi prototype of mobile and website" height="800">
          <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/hifi-mobile.png" alt="Hifi prototype of mobile and website" height="800">
        </div>

        <br>
        <br>



        <h2>Responsive Redesign of Website</h2>
        <p>
          Finally, I created a website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to demonstrate my high fidelity prototype. Given that that is my first project with HTML, there are a few issues that should be noted: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The menu bar has a margin that is not intended to be there. The margin is not present in Figma prototypes, but due to the Bootstrap template I am using, I was unable to remove it. 
          </li>
          <li>
            I used Bootstrap to create interactive buttons. Because there are limitations with Bootstrap, I was unable to provide all the buttons with the same intended design as provided in the visual design guide. Hypothetically, the website should stick with the color and theme as indicated in the visual design guide. 
          </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <p>
          My final website design can be found <a href="https://sleepyotter123.github.io/russel-orchards/">here</a>
        </p>
        <br>


        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The design of a website is critical to its effectiveness in conveying information to the user. Every website has a different goal (ex. Selling a product, providing information about an event, etc.) The goal of Russell Orchard’s website is to draw users to the farm by providing information about the opening hours, occurring events, as well as access to the farm. 
          <br>
          <br>
          This assignment has taught me the principles of design, as well as technical skills in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

          <div class="pamela-image">
            <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/pamela.png" alt="Empathy Map for Procrastinating Pamela. Pamela tends to leave assignments to the last minute, and is always in a rush." height="550">
          </div>

          <div class="persona-text">
            <p>
              The first persona I constructed is Procrastinating Pamela. Pamela is a busy college student taking five courses and involved in multiple extracurricular clubs. She has a tendency to leave assignments for the last minute. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Pamela uses the printer frequently to print her readings and homework assignments. Her main problem with the current interface is that it does not support adjusting the number of copies needed. Additionally, Pamela finds the interface for the printer to be slow, and the printing process is longer than she prefers. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Pamela represents the busy students using the printers across Brown. Many students frequently use the printer, but find it inconvenient to submit multiple documents or print multiple copies. These students are looking for convenient and efficient ways to print necessary documents. 
    
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
    
        
        <div class = "abe"> 
          <div class = "persona-text">
            <p>
              The second persona I constructed is Artsy Abe. Abe is a first year Brown-RISD Dual Degree student who just moved to campus, and is looking to fill his room with decor. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Abe has never used the printers at Brown before. His main problem with the interface is that there are no directions for submitting documents to the printer. The home screen on the monitor does not immediately suggest the printer is associated with the monitor, which causes Abe to struggle with using the printer.
              <br>
              <br>
              Abe represents the new students on campus who are unfamiliar with the printer. These users are not necessarily printing with urgency, but rather using the printer as a device to express creativity. People like Abe are looking for quality prints, rather than a fast printing speed.

        </div>  


        <h2>Storyboard</h2>
        <p>
          I detailed Artsy Abe's user journey from start to end using a storyboard. The following storyboard provides detail and context about Abe's background and experinece with the printer's interface.
        </p>

        <div class="storyboard">

        </div>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          This project gave me experience in observing users' interaction with an interface. I learned how to document observations and ask detailed, yet unbiased questions. 
          Creating personas and a storyboard gave me the chance to deeply understand a specific subset of users and their hardships with the printing interface at Brown.
